How to Bet
----------
Remember this is alpha alpha software and there should not be any more coins in your account than you are willing to lose.

The `Multiplier` box contains the number your bet will be multiplied by on a win
The `Steps` box contains the number of iterations the betting strategy will use until the number of steps is exceeded.

The chrome extension uses the `bet size` to make the initial bet.
