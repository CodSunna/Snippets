This is a prototype script do not use this unless you fully understand the code and are comfortable with a chance to lose 
all you have in your on site balance.

I accept no responsibility for any losses

This script plays with a 0.0042378367% chance to bust over 35 bets so by no means is this a guaranteed winning strategy.

I ended up with a 41 losing streak that almost completely bust this http://i.imgur.com/GUgyh2O.jpg.

mrblack himself won a small amount then suffered a long losing streak http://i.imgur.com/2xGg12l.png.

Although this was a fun project and I have learnt a lot, I feel that it is far from a winning method and reccomend that 

people do not use this bot for anything other than fun.
